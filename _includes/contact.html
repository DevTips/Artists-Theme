I dont have jekyll and I have allot of homework so I don't have time to set it up but this code should work pretty well. 
It probably* needs prettyfication, so I leave it up to you to do that! I just saw your latest vid and knew that I HAD to do this.
*deffinately

It gives the responses to a google form, which is in my account but there is a link below to see responses. From tehre you can just 
cop and paste all the users. I would recomend userss of this actually doing it themselves, though, it's not that hard.

How To Do:
1) create google form
2) click view live form
3) view source codes
4) copy everything inside the form tag
5) cut out all the crap
6) HAVEN'T GOTTEN HERE THIS PART IS TIME CONSUMING AND NEEDS JEKYLL OR SOMETHING make it pretty
7) enjoy!
